# Contributing to Sleep Sage

First off — thanks for even reading this. Sleep Sage is a weird little project built out of love for dreams, clean design, and functional AI. If you're here, you're probably my kind of strange.

This guide explains how to help out, what’s expected, and how not to piss me off.

## Ground Rules

- Be kind. Be thoughtful. No dream is too weird.
- Keep things clean. Architect with care.
- This app is *dark-mode-first* — respect the vibe.
- We prefer clarity over cleverness.
- AI is a tool, not the whole product.

---

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs (nicely)
- Suggest dream-related feature ideas
- Submit clean PRs with clear intent
- Improve docs or style guides
- Help with accessibility improvements
- Refactor or tidy code (but don’t bikeshed me to death)

---

## Code Style & Standards

- Use Prettier. No debates.
- Tailwind is life here.
- Stick to existing patterns unless you have a damn good reason not to.
- Write small, focused commits with clear messages.
- File structure follows `STRUCTURE.md`.

## PR Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `feature/what-you're-doing`
3. Commit clean, clear changes
4. Open PR with description
5. I’ll review & roast (lightly)

Please use GitHub Issues for:

- Bugs
- Feature ideas

Tag appropriately:

## Code of Conduct

Don’t be a dick.

Seriously though — be cool, be helpful, and respect that this is a side project born from curiosity and sleep-deprived nonsense.

---

All contributions will be under GPL — free forever, open forever.

Dream well. Code clean.
